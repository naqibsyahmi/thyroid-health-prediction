# üè• ü¶† Prediction of Thyroid Hormone Levels and Diagnosis of Thyroid Disorders

## üìù Introduction

Thyroid disorders, including **hypothyroidism** and **hyperthyrodism**, are **prevalent endocrine conditions** that can significantly impact **metabolic health**. Globally, the **incidence of thyroid dysfunction** is increasing, with studies indicating that thyroid disorders affect a substantial portion of the population [1]. **Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**, produced by the pituitary gland, plays a pivotal role in regulating thyroid function and is a primary marker for assessing thyroid health [2].

In this project, we are utilizing the Hyperthyroid dataset, originally sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and made available via Kaggle [3], to develop **predictive models** with two primary objectives. First, we are constructing a regression model to **estimate TSH levels** based on **clinical and demographic features**. Second, we are developing a **binary classification model** to determine whether an individual exhibits signs of thyroid dysfunction. By integrating both regression and classification, this projects aims to **enhance early diagnosis** and **support effective clinical decision-making** for thyroid health management.

## üéØ Project Objectives

1. To build a regression model that estimates thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels based on clinical and demographic features.

2. To develop a binary classification model that distinguishes between individuals with thyroid dysfunction and those with normal thyroid function.

3. To evaluate the effectiveness of both models in providing accurate predictions that can aid in medical decision-making and early intervention.

## ‚ùì Project Questions

1. Can we accurately predict an individual's TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level based on clinical and demographic data?

2. Can we determine whether an individual has thyroid dysfunction (e.g., hypothyroidism) or is in a normal state using available features in the dataset?
